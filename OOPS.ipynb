        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around creating objects—which are instances of classes—that bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It aims to model real-world entities and their interactions.\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP\n",
        "    -  In OOP, a class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP\n",
        "    -  In OOP, an object is a specific instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "   -  Abstraction is about hiding complexity.\n",
        "   -Encapsulation is about protecting internal data.  \n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        " -  Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) in Python are special methods that have names surrounded by double underscores, like __init__, __str__, or __add__. They define certain behaviors or behaviors for classes and objects, enabling features like operator overloading, object initialization, and custom string representation.\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "   - Inheritance in OOP is a way to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (called a superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, allowing code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own way. It allows a single interface to represent different underlying data types or classes.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "   -  Encapsulation in Python is mainly achieved through data hiding—restricting direct access to an object's internal data.\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "   - A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__(). It's automatically invoked when you create a new object of a class, and it's used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "     -   Class methods:Defined with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "         The first parameter is cls, representing the class itself.\n",
        "     -    Static methods:Defined with the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "          They do not receive an implicit first argument (self or cls).\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "     - Method overloading—the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters—is not directly supported in Python like in some other languages. If you define a method multiple times, the last definition overwrites the previous ones.\n",
        "12.  What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "     -  Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the overridden version in the subclass is executed instead of the one in the superclass.\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "     -  A property decorator in Python is a built-in way to define methods that behave like attributes. It allows you to add getter, setter, and deleter functions to manage access to a class attribute, enabling encapsulation and control over attribute access, all while keeping the syntax simple and clean.            \n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "     -Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface, typically via inheritance or interfaces. This leads to flexible, scalable, and maintainable code by enabling\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "     -  An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that derived classes must implement, ensuring a common interface.\n",
        "16.  What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "     - Modularity\n",
        "     -Reusability\n",
        "     -Scalability\n",
        "     -Maintainability\n",
        "     -Abstraction\n",
        "     -Flexibility\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an\n",
        "     instance variable\n",
        "     - Class Variable: Shared across all instances of the class. Defined at the class level and accessed via the class or instances.\n",
        "    - Instance Variable: Specific to each object instance. Defined inside methods (usually __init__) and unique to each object.\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "     -   Multiple inheritance in Python occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class. It allows a subclass to incorporate features and behaviors from multiple classes, promoting code reuse and flexibility.\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "     -  _str__: Provides a human-readable, user-friendly string representation of an object. It is used by print() and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "     - __repr__: Provides an unambiguous, developer-focused string representation of an object, ideally one that could be used to recreate the object. It is used by repr() and in debugging.\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "     - The super() function in Python is crucial for working with inheritance, especially when you're dealing with class hierarchies. Its main purpose is to call methods from a parent (or superclass) from within a subclass, ensuring that the inherited behavior is executed correctly and avoiding redundant code.\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "     -   The __del__ method in Python is a special or \"destructor\" method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, usually when its reference count drops to zero. It allows you to define cleanup actions that should happen when an object is no longer needed—like closing files, releasing resources, or saving data.\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "od for utility functions related to the class but independent of class/instance data.\n",
        "     - Use @classmethod when the method needs to access or modify class state.\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "     - Polymorphism in Python, especially with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly based on common behavior or interface, even if their internal implementations differ.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "     - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement. To enable method chaining, each method must return the object itself (self), allowing the next method to operate on the same instance.\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "     - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be used like a function. When an object has a __call__ method defined, you can call it using parentheses as if it were a function.              \n",
        "       \n",
